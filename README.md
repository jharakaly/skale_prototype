# SkalePrototype

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Homepage should look like this with the footer down below - 
  I updated the buttons a little bit and remove the vertical line on the side of the replies

On the homepage we have like and reply underneath the comments. That's the latest comment for that group.
That reply btn should open up to standard reply from the subgroup_topics2 page

Within beginner vegan is the correct functionality for read more and view replies. On the homepage and activity page, the functionality is flawed. Please use the processes on beginner vegan for both of those buttons across the site.
When you click on the content in the body of the topic, it should expand that fully. When you click view replies, it should expand that content fully, and then show the replies below with the collapsible and expandable comments within it

Within the activity feed, there is a my perfect vegan chocolate cake recipe post. That is a topic and it has a new reply on it.
When you click view replies, that should expand the completed topic out with the replies expanded as well showing the latest one that has been added to it. This functionality should come from the beginner vegan page..
I do like having the reply that was added, showing below the topic

For the search bar on the groups and subgroup topics pages I wanna have it look like the one on the subgroup_building_culture file

On the group_building_skale page the events containers not responding properly. It should be expanded down to full height of the page like it is on the homepage.
Also, the building scale topic container should be aligned with the top of the events container
